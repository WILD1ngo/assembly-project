Use your keyboard to play the corresponding piano keys.

Aim for accuracy and timing to achieve the best scores.

Progress through levels and unlock new songs and challenges.

Levels
Song Mode consists of multiple levels, each with its unique set of songs and increasing difficulty. Challenge yourself to improve your skills and unlock all the songs in the game.
